The funds need to be re-appropriated in FY2025.\n\nThe Center requested a market feasibility study be conducted to explore the viability of expanding the Tampa Convention Center.  It included a market analysis of current and future convention business, options for funding, and an inventory of hotel rooms that are needed to accommodate any expansion.  This study will be the key component in developing a master plan for the Center.\n\nThe Center is conducting a facility assessment of its infrastructure to include mechanical, electrical, fire suppression, and structural.  There is no current data that shows the life expectancy of these critical facility infrastructures.  The information garnered from this assessment will allow the Center to create a fiscally sound Capital Improvement Plan to replace equipment that is over 30 years old and nearing its end of useful life.   It will also allow us to prioritize which equipment needs to be replaced.  This is significant due to the nature of the convention industry.  The Center needs to provide services to our clients to keep them in our booking rotation, as well as attract new business by providing a facility that is up to date and not failing.",

On June 5, 1974, TUS was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places (NRHP Reference Number 74000640) and in 1988 it received local landmark status from the City of Tampa.  In 1998, TUS was restored and reopened and today serves as a Amtrack Station for the Silver Star Line linking Tampa Bay with Miami southbound and New York City northbound. TUS also uses a wye to point trains, on six (6) tracks via three (3) platforms, away from the depot.\n\nPursuant to Resolution 2023-77 dated January 19, 2023, the City and the Firm entered into an Agreement for Design-Build Initial Services.\n\nPursuant to Resolution 2024-1073 dated November 21, 2024, the City and the Firm entered into a Design-Build Services Agreement with a Guaranteed Maximum Price.\n\nThe City has been awarded a grant from the State of Florida in the amount of $408,806.

All new construction shall make the best use of all applicable and sustainable materials and methodologies as well as energy producing and savings technologies including but not limited to solar panels in accordance with the Request for Qualifications and Design Criteria Package.\n\n6. Community Engagement: The Contract Administration Department will assist the Contractor in all communication efforts to ensure transparency and integration of the stakeholders.\n\n7.Project: a.

      "background": "The Florida Legislature created the Voluntary Cleanup Tax Credit (VCTC) to encourage participants to conduct voluntary cleanup of certain drycleaning solvent contaminated sites and brownfield sites in designated brownfield areas.  Participants must meet the eligibility criteria established in the Florida Statute and must enter into a voluntary cleanup agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  If costs are eligible for a tax credit, the participant could claim 50% of the cost for solid waste removal, but not to exceed $500,000.\n\nSince 2015, the City has been awarded 21 VCTC certificates with a combined tax credit value of $3.0 million, from which $2.9 million has been sold.  The City currently has three tax credits related to the Hanna Ave, Main Street Park and Jackson Street Parking lot brownfield site rehabilitation projects totaling $116,513.24 that are available for sale.\n\nAs the City, being a tax-exempt entity, has no ability to utilize the Tax Credits to offset its tax obligations, the City has engaged Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. to locate a purchaser for these Tax Credits.  Resolution 2023-798 approved the agreement between the City of Tampa and Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. to provide brokerage services for the marketing and selling of VCTCs issued by FDEP to the City.  Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. solicited proposals and has recommended U.S. Bank National Association as having submitted the best proposal.\n\nThe agreement will accept the U.S. Bank National Association proposal of $0.935 per dollar of tax credit sold, which will result in proceeds of $108,939.88. After agent fees of $2,901.18, or $0.0249 per dollar of tax credit sold, the City will receive $106,038.70 net, or $0.91 per dollar of tax credit sold.",

Participants must meet the eligibility criteria established in the Florida Statute and must enter into a voluntary cleanup agreement with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  If costs are eligible for a tax credit, the participant could claim 50% of the cost for solid waste removal, but not to exceed $500,000.\n\nSince 2015, the City has been awarded 21 VCTC certificates with a combined tax credit value of $3.0 million, from which $2.9 million has been sold.  The City currently has three tax credits related to the Hanna Ave, Main Street Park and Jackson Street Parking lot brownfield site rehabilitation projects totaling $116,513.24 that are available for sale.\n\nAs the City, being a tax-exempt entity, has no ability to utilize the Tax Credits to offset its tax obligations, the City has engaged Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. to locate a purchaser for these Tax Credits.  Resolution 2023-798 approved the agreement between the City of Tampa and Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. to provide brokerage services for the marketing and selling of VCTCs issued by FDEP to the City.  Clocktower Tax Credits, LLC. solicited proposals and has recommended U.S. Bank National Association as having submitted the best proposal.\n\nThe agreement between the City and U.S. Bank National Association proposes a purchasing price of $0.935 per dollar of tax credit sold, which will result in proceeds of $108,939.88. After agent fees of $2,901.18, or $0.0249 per dollar of tax credit sold, the City will receive $106,038.70 net, or $0.91 per dollar of tax credit sold.",

The Update received conditional approval from the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with final approval contingent upon adoption.\n\nThe LMS 2025 Update also supports the City’s participation in the National Flood Insurance Program’s (NFIP) Community Rating System (CRS), post-disaster redevelopment efforts, and county code implementation.\n\nThe Program for Public Information (PPI) is a new and updated tool to improve communication and provide additional resources on flood hazards, flood safety, flood insurance, and other floodplain-related topics. The PPI was introduced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a planning tool to provide a step-by-step coordinated strategy for flood hazard outreach. By adopting a PPI, the City is able to more effectively provide information on this important topic and is also able to obtain additional CRS credit that would otherwise be unavailable.\n\nThe adoption of a PPI provides the City with opportunities to improve its CRS rating. An improved CRS rating increases the discounts that unincorporated residents receive on their flood insurance policies. For the PPI to qualify in the CRS Program and provide additional points toward the rating, Council approval of the PPI is required.",
