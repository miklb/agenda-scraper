13. File No. PS25-15192 Resolution approving Quote No. 231046071 for Vehicle Repair Services for Fire Vehicle #7512, a 2018 Pierce Quantum Pumper Fire Engine by Ten-8 Fire & Safety, LLC in the estimated amount of $284,569.97 for use by the Tampa Fire Rescue Department.

**Background:**
It is recommended that the City award Vehicle Repair Services for Engine 1 Vehicle 7512 2018 Pierce Quantum to Ten-8 Fire & Safety LLC for use by the Fleet department. The Manager of the Fleet Maintenance Division submitted a letter of conditions and circumstances stating the need for repairs to Fire Department Vehicle #7512, a 2018 Pierce Quantum Pumper. This letter of conditions and circumstances was approved by the Director of Purchasing, with final approval contingent upon City Council approval. Per Pierce Manufacturing Inc., Ten-8 Fire & Safety LLC is the only entity authorized to repair Pierce vehicles in Florida. It is recommended that the City purchase necessary repairs for Fire Department Vehicle #7512. Following accident-related damage, Ten-8 Fire and Safety, the authorized Pierce dealer for our area, evaluated the city's 2018 Pierce Quantum Pumper. The assessment revealed extensive midship damage requiring structural repairs, which are estimated to cost $284,569.97. After careful analysis, it was determined that repairing the vehicle is both economically feasible and operationally practical. A replacement apparatus would cost over $1 million and be subject to a 32–35-month production lead time, during which critical fire response capabilities would be reduced. The current unit is only 7 years old, with an expected service life of 15 to 20 years, meaning it has 8 to 13 years of viable service remaining post- repair. Given the significantly lower cost of repair and the long remaining service life, repairing the unit represents a cost-effective use of public funds and ensures the continued availability of emergency response resources without the extended delay of procurement. There was no EBO Participation as this purchase is being made under a letter of conditions and circumstances (LOCC).

51. File No. F25-14830 Resolution approving an RF-Smart On-Line Services Agreement for RF-Smart for Oracle Cloud Order Document between the City of Tampa and Information & Computing Services, Inc. for the furnishing of the RF-Smart Inventory and Fixed Asset Management System Software, Services and Support in the estimated amount of $314,539.20 for use by the Technology and Innovation Department.

**Background:**
The City of Tampa has a need to continue software, service and support for the RF-SMART Inventory and Asset Management System for Oracle Cloud (the “System”) as provided by Information & Computing Services, Inc. for use by the Technology and Innovation Department to support the Purchasing Department Inventory and Revenue & Finance Department Fixed Asset and Property Management operations. Pursuant to Resolution 2022-823 the Online Services Agreement, Statement of Work, and Order Document between the City of Tampa and Information & Computing Services, Inc. was approved by the City of Tampa City Council on September 15, 2022. The City of Tampa migrated from Oracle EBS to Oracle Cloud in November 2021. During the Oracle Cloud implementation, it was discovered that Oracle no longer provides software to support mobile scanners for its warehousing systems and instead relies on third party providers for these products and services. The Oracle Cloud implementation team referred the City to their preferred partner for this software which is RF-SMART provided by Information & Computing Services, Inc. This provider is the only mobile scanner application recommended by Oracle and it is written specifically to work with the Oracle Cloud system and performs real-time updates to the Oracle database. No other software option has this capability and RF-SMART competitors rely on custom batch interfaces to perform updates which requires additional costs and maintenance support. The RF-SMART software only works with Oracle Cloud and is not compatible with any other system. The RF-SMART software application also resolves another issue faced by the City's Property Control department which currently utilizes Strategic Asset Systems asset management software (SATS) to support their annual capital asset inventory process. The SATS system is no longer supported and the City has not found another solution that will easily interface to Oracle Cloud other than the RF-SMART system. The RF-SMART application meets the requirements of both the Procurement Department's Inventory Warehouses and Revenue and Finance Department's Property Control Section operations. There was no EBO Participation as this purchase was made thru an LOCC.

59. File No. DEO25-14958 Resolution making certain changes in the budget of the City of Tampa for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025; approving the transfer, reallocation, and/or appropriation of $9,480 within the HOME Investment Partnerships Program Grant Fund for HOME American Rescue Plan (ARP) Program Grant Activities.

**Background:**
In 2021, HUD’s Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) allocated $5 billion appropriated by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) of 2021 to HOME Investment Partnerships Program participating jurisdictions. While conducting recent quality control efforts, the Department discovered an administrative error in the allocations of the HOME- ARP funds. This error resulted in the City of Tampa inadvertently being allocated less HOME- ARP funds than it was legally entitled to receive.

60. File No. DEO25-15000 Resolution approving the execution by the Mayor and attestation by the City Clerk of a First Amendment to Private Dock Agreement between the City of Tampa and Timothy W. Swett and Heather L. Swett, Trustees of the Timothy W. Swett Revocable Trust dated May 24, 2016 and Heather L. Swett and Timothy W. Swett, Trustees of the Heather L. Swett Revocable Trust dated May 24, 2016 for the construction and operation of certain dock structures and facilities on and over submerged lands owned and held by the City in the vicinity of 2719 N. Riverside Drive, Tampa, Florida.

**Background:**
Timothy W. Swett and Heather L. Swett are the owners of upland property located at 2719 N. Riverside Drive and enjoy certain riparian rights to the waters of the Hillsborough River. The City of Tampa owns certain submerged sovereign lands below the waters of the Hillsborough River that abut the upland property. The owners constructed dock facilities pursuant to EPC Permit # 78575(R1), including dock repair to an existing dock, the installation of one non-covered boatlift, and after-the-fact installation of a manual kayak lift. Since the dock facilities will be located over or on a portion of submerged sovereign lands owned by the City, the parties desire to enter into a First Amendment to Private Dock Agreement regarding the owners’ right to erect, use and maintain the dock facilities as constructed and incorporate the kayak lift into the existing Private Dock Agreement.

66. File No. DEO25-15291 Resolution approving a form of a Release of Easement to be used when a release of easement application has been received and approved administratively by the City of Tampa; approving the execution by the Mayor and attestation by the City Clerk to all future release of easements using the attached form without subsequent or separate approval by City Council as to each request.

**Background:**
The Development and Growth Management Department (DGM) receives 40-50 Release of Easement Applications annually for abandoned or unused easements originally dedicated to the City of Tampa through various documents like plats, ordinances, and deeds. These easements are often outdated and no longer serve their intended purpose. Most applications require a release form signed by the Mayor after City Council approval. To streamline the process for routine releases, it's beneficial for the City Council to approve a standard release form that the Mayor can execute without further Council approval when there's no current or future need for the easement. Therefore, it's in the City's best interest for the Council to approve the attached form for unilateral releases.

68. File No. DEO25-15326 Resolution approving the execution by the Mayor and attestation by the City Clerk of a Second Amendment to Lease Agreement between the City of Tampa, as tenant, and GTE Federal Credit Union d/b/a GTE Financial, as landlord, to amend certain provisions of the lease on the real property located at 711 E. Henderson Avenue, Tampa, Florida as it pertains to the data center.

**Background:**
The City of Tampa’s Technology and Innovation Department (T&I) currently leases space at the GTE headquarters building at 711 E. Henderson Avenue for its data center under the Lease Agreement dated November 15, 2016, approved by Resolution 2016-885, as amended (Lease). Currently, annual base rent is $200,000 and the Lease is set to terminate on October 31, 2025. T&I, through the Real Estate Department, requested the term of the Lease be extended. The Real Estate and T&I staff were able to negotiate an extension in the Lease term for two additional years with three options to renew at one year each and the leased space was reduced from 2,640 square feet to 1,185 square feet. Due to the reduction in the leased space, the initial annual base rent has been reduced to $89,775.60, saving the City over $100,000/year in rent. The reduced base rent takes effect on July 1, 2025 and will affect the final four months of the current term.

69. File No. DEO25-15327 Resolution approving the execution by the Mayor and attestation by the City Clerk of a Lease Agreement between the City of Tampa, as tenant, and GTE Federal Credit Union d/b/a GTE Financial, as landlord, for additional office space located at 711 E. Henderson Avenue, Tampa, Florida, for use by the Water Department and Emergency Operations.

**Background:**
The City of Tampa Water Department, in collaboration with the Emergency Management team, seeks approval to lease additional office space at the GTE headquarters building located at 711 E. Henderson Avenue. This lease expansion is primarily intended to support the relocation of the Water Department’s Customer Service Call Center and secure sleeping quarters during emergency response activation, with potential complementary uses also under consideration. The Water Department plans to move its Call Center from the Columbus Municipal Office Building (CMOB), where current space limitations and layout constraints make it unsuitable for high-volume customer service operations. The new space at GTE will allow the Water Department to consider co-locating the Call Center with its Billing Section, which is currently based at the 40th Street Yard. Since most incoming calls relate to billing for water, wastewater, and solid waste services, bringing these teams together could improve coordination and response times. Since the Engineering staff are already located at GTE, there may also be opportunities to enhance support for construction and field-related calls. Relocating the Billing Section could eventually help free up space at the 40th Street Yard, where the Distribution team is currently facing space constraints. The new space will serve a dual function by housing the Call Center during normal operations and providing sleeping quarters for response personnel during emergency activations. While the primary near-term focus is on customer service relocation and emergency sleeping accommodations, the lease gives both departments flexibility to adapt the space over time as operational needs evolve. This shared-use arrangement offers a practical and cost-conscious approach to improving service delivery while expanding emergency response capabilities. The Lease Agreement is for approximately 2,376 square feet of additional office space. The initial term of the lease is one year with three one-year renewals, and an initial annual base rent of $59,400. Additionally, the Resolution requests up to $100,000 for future improvements to the space. The Emergency Management team will fund the lease from July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. Beginning January 1, 2026, the Water Department will assume full responsibility for the lease, including any renewal options.

70. File No. DEO25-15328 Resolution approving the execution by the Mayor and attestation by the City Clerk of a License and Hold Harmless Agreement between City of Tampa and National Railroad Passenger Corporation for City property known as Tampa Union Station located at 601 N. Nebraska Avenue, Tampa, Florida, for the temporary relocation of rail passenger operations; providing an effective date. Memorandum from Michelle Van Loan, Director of Real Estate, requesting that said item be removed from the agenda. 

**Background:**
The City of Tampa and National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) entered into an Amended and Restated Lease Agreement dated August 26, 1999, approved by Resolution No. 99-830, as amended (Lease), involving a portion of City-owned Tampa Union Station for the operation of Amtrak’s passenger rail operations. The term of the lease expired on August 18, 2024, and while Amtrak is currently holding over occupancy pursuant to Section 1.06(c) thereof. Their submittal was accepted, and we are negotiating a new lease pursuant to RFP No. 25-P-00067. The City is renovating Tampa Union Station under the Design-Build Services Agreement with a Guaranteed Maximum Price for City Contract 22-C-00038-GMP01 dated November 21, 2024, between the City and Collage Design and Construction Group, Inc. d/b/a The Collage Companies, approved by Resolution No. 2024-1073. Due to the renovations, Amtrak must temporarily relocate its operations from their tenant space to other portions of the property as depicted below (Temporary Facilities), which includes a modular building and a portion of the station’s baggage building. Amtrak, through the City of Tampa’s Logistics and Asset Management and Contract Administration Departments, requests a License and Hold Harmless Agreement (Agreement) to codify certain details of the temporary relocation of Amtrak’s business operations. The term of the agreement is one year. Amtrak may submit invoices to Collage for reimbursement of relocation costs, up to $48,500. The City budget will not have an additional fiscal impact as a result of this Agreement with Amtrak. Staff respectfully request the approval of the License and Hold Harmless Agreement.

Kennedy Blvd., 3rd Floor, Tampa, FL 33602, by the City Council of the City of Tampa for consideration of a Special Magistrate's Report and Recommendation issued pursuant to Section 70.51, Florida Statutes, with respect to a mediated settlement for the property located at 1411 N. 17th Street, 1707 E. 4th Avenue, and 1715 E. 4th Avenue; Providing for notice.

**Background:**
On March 26, 2024, the Barrio Latino Commission (“BLC”) approved a certificate of appropriateness for construction of a new four-level apartment complex over on-level parking with site improvements for the property located at 1411 N. 17th Street, 1707 E. 4th Avenue, and 1715 E. 4th Avenue ("Property'') for BLC 22-185. On April 10, 2024, in accordance with Section 27-61 of the City of Tampa Code of Ordinances, a petition for review of the BLC’s approval of BLC 22-185 was filed by an aggrieved person, Nick Capitano, Inc. and on August 1, 2024, the City Council of the City of Tampa (“City Council”) held a de novo review hearing on the certificate of appropriateness for BLC 22-185 and, after hearing evidence and testimony from those present, overturned the BLC’s approval for a certificate of appropriateness for the Property. On August 30, 2024, counsel for the Property owners ("Petitioner") served the City with a Request for Relief pursuant to section 70.51, Florida Statutes ("Request") (a/k/a Bert J. Harris, Jr., Private Property Rights Protection Act) and in accordance with section 70.51, Florida Statutes, Petitioner and City staff participated in a mediation on February 28, 2025, and April 14, 2025, to explore options and attempt to settle the matter. The revised site plan resulting from the mediation and presented by Petitioner addresses the concerns raised by City Council on August 1, 2024 ("Redesigned Plan") and on April 23, 2025, the Special Magistrate Issued a Report and Recommendation recommending favorable consideration of Petitioner's Redesigned Plan. The Report and Recommendation is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by reference. On May 27, 2025, the BLC held a public hearing to review the Redesigned Plan and the Report and Recommendation (together, the “Proposed Settlement”) and found the proposed project is consistent with the City Code, the “Ybor City Design Guidelines”, and the Secretary of the Interior standards, with conditions (balconies on rear elevations as presented at the public hearing) and on May 27, 2025, the BLC recommended that the City Council approve the Proposed Settlement for the Property. Consideration by City Council of the Proposed Settlement must occur during a properly noticed public hearing in accordance with Section 27-149, Land Development Code and if, following the noticed public hearing, the Proposed Settlement is approved by City Council,

92. File No. Z03-77  - An ordinance Amending Ordinance No. 2004-14, passed and ordained by the City Council of the City of Tampa on January 8, 2004, rezoning property in the general vicinity of 4905 Price Avenue in the City of Tampa, Florida, to correct a Scrivener’s Error by substituting a corrected legal description attached to said ordinance as Exhibit “A”.

**Background:**
On January 8, 2004, Tampa City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2004-14, which approved rezoning application Z03-77 for the property generally located at 4905 Price Avenue changing the zoning district classification from Commercial Intensive (CI) to Planned Development (PD – Single Family Residential Attached) and it was recently discovered that while the site development plan dated November 26, 2003 and attached to Ordinance No. 2004-14 as Exhibit “B”, is accurate, the legal description attached as Exhibit “A” is incorrect and not consistent with the parcel depicted on the approved site development plan. A review of the public hearings held on rezoning application Z03-77 confirmed the intent of Tampa City Council to rezone the parcel generally located at 4905 Price Avenue as depicted on the site development plan dated November 26, 2003 attached to Ordinance No. 2004-14 as Exhibit “B” and it is necessary to amend Ordinance No. 2004-14 to correct a scrivener’s error by substituting a corrected legal description attached as Exhibit “A” for the previous Exhibit “A” that was supplied in error.

94. File No. MAM25-15191 (Placed under Staff Reports and Unfinished Business pursuant to a motion made by Council.) Resolution approving the renewal of an award between the City of Tampa and Air Mechanical & Service Corp., with a 2.8% Consumer Price Index (CPI) price escalation, for the provision of Citywide HVAC Services in the estimated amount of $3,800,000 for use by the Department of Logistics and Asset Management/Facility Management Division; authorizing the Director or Purchasing to purchase said property, supplies, materials or services; providing an effective date. 

**Background:**
It is recommended that the City renew its existing award with Air Mechanical and Service Corp. for the provision of Citywide HVAC Services for use by the Logistics & Asset Management/Facilities Division for an additional one-year term. The existing award was made July 14, 2022: This award is in its second renewal term which was extended to May 2, 2025, per the bid document Section 4.13.1 Supplemental Unilateral Renewal Periods. Air Mechanical provides excellent service, quality of product and performance. The Logistics and Asset Management Department/Facility Management division has reviewed the prices and feels that it is in the best interest of the City to renew the award for an additional one-year period. Air Mechanical has agreed to renew Citywide HVAC services with a Consumer Price Index (CPI) price escalation of 2.8% which is allowed per the bid. WMBE/SLBE participation goals were not prescribed in the solicitation because scope did not meet required EBO parameters: however it did not preclude participation as this is an annual renewal.
