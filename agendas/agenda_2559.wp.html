<p>This version of the agenda is meant to be an easier way to skim the items before diving into the full draft and back up items. It also is meant as an archive for search. Often I remember something being on the agenda but not sure when. While the ongoing work with Onbase continues, and there is some search functionality here I can cross reference with agenda previews, then look at the original agenda.</p>
