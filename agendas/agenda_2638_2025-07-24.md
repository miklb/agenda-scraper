14. File No. CRA25-15835 Resolution of the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Tampa Florida relating to community redevelopment in the Central Park Community Redevelopment Area; recommending the adoption of a proposed modification to the Community Redevelopment Plan, which would amend, replace and supersede the existing Community Redevelopment Plan for the Central Park Community Redevelopment Area in its entirety, to the City Council of the City of Tampa, Florida; directing the Secretary of the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Tampa, Florida to submit this resolution as the Agency's written recommendation and a copy of said proposed modified Community Redevelopment Plan to the City Council of the City of Tampa, Florida and to each taxing authority, as defined in section 163.340, Florida Statutes , that levies Ad Valorem taxes on taxable real property contained within the geographic boundaries of the Central Park Community Redevelopment Area.
